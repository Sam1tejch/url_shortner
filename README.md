# url_shortner
Created a URL shortener using Python and FastAPI to convert long, complicated URLs into shorter, easier-to-share links. This makes URLs more user-friendly and memorable.

This includes various API endpoints that handle different HTTP request types. Each endpoint  performs a specific action related to URL shortening.
